This is one of my favourite

the important chats starts from here:

      Girl: You look desperate to me
    
girl making her feel bad for his behaviour

    Guy: I think a lot more than this is needed to get me chasing, I'm choosy ;)

guy Changing the subject + not feeling bad about his bheviour and not falling into her frame

    Guy: like having some of my weaknesses for starters

creating curiosity in girls mind

    Girl: Okk like
Acepting his question, and wants to know about him

    Guy: Cute smile ...
Going direct and bold, which is risky btw

    Girl: Do i even fit in any of them
she also wants to go bold, and want him to proceed further


If i find some more chats that are worth sharing, i'll update this repo
